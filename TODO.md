# TODO / Ideas for Future Experiments

- [ ] Experiment with GraphQL endpoints for CRUD and queries
- [ ] Integrate and react to PostgreSQL events (LISTEN/NOTIFY, triggers, CDC)
- [ ] Implement advanced transactional database operations (e.g. distributed transactions, savepoints, custom isolation levels)
